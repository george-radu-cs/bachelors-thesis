# Bachelor's license

This repo contains the source code of my bachelor's license project. It is a flashcard application for mobile devices, written in Flutter. The application is designed to help students learn new information in a more efficient way.

The source code for the application client is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/george-radu-cs/alfie-client).

The source code for the application cloud services is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/george-radu-cs/alfie-cloud-services).
